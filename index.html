                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <img src = "founders.jpg" alt = "Founders Jason and Maria in their nursery">
                    <p>
                        Based in Tucson, Arizona, Lucky Shrub was founded by a husband-and-wife team, Jason and Maria, 
                        who share a deep passion for plant life. Their journey began with a simple idea—to make it easier 
                        for gardeners to find and care for high-quality shrubs suited for the region’s climate. What started 
                        as a small collection of their personal favorites soon blossomed into a one-stop shop for beautiful, 
                        low-maintenance, and sustainable shrubs that enhance any landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Lucky Shrub, we believe that shrubs are the backbone of a great garden. They provide structure, 
                        color, and year-round interest, transforming outdoor spaces into vibrant, thriving landscapes. Our 
                        goal is to offer a carefully curated selection of healthy, hardy shrubs that will not only survive 
                        but thrive in your garden.
